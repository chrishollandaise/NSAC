# NSAC - Getting Started

# Description
Note Sequence and Arrangement Classifier (NSAC) is a machine-learning model that identifies unique or repeatable sequences and then classifies them into their respective sections. This model will be featured in an upcoming mod for Beat Saber. Stay tuned!

Here are the steps for getting the repository up and running on your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/chrishollandaise/NSAC.git
cd NSAC
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Check out the projects tab on Github to see the current progress on the project and tasks that still need to be done.
